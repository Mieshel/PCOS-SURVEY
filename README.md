# Overview
Welcome to the PCOS Survey Dashboard, designed in showcasing my expertise in data visualization, charting, and pivot table usage.The data collected from surveys related to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) where gotten form women (15-56yrs). This dashboard aims to provide insights into various aspects of PCOS  awareness and symptoms  based on the survey responses.

# *Final Insight*
Based on the analysis of survey data collected, a notable finding is that women in their 20s are more likely to exhibit symptoms of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) compared to other age groups. These symptoms include irregular menstrual cycles, weight gain, excessive hair growth, acne, and hormonal imbalances.
Despite experiencing symptoms, many women in their 20s may be unaware of PCOS or its implications. This lack of awareness can delay diagnosis and treatment, potentially aggrevate symptoms and affecting overall health.
